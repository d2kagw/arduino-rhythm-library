A small library that records the frequency between events.
That frequency can later be used for timing events.

To install (on OSX):

1. `cd` to your default Arduino directory
2. Run this in the directory `git clone git://github.com/d2kagw/arduino-rhythm-library.git Tap`
3. Open (or relaunch) the Arduino IDE
4. Select `Sketch > Import Library... > Tap`
5. Profit.

There's no example directory for this library since the setup is quite complex.
However, you can find a detailed blog posting and schematic for a full Arduino project [here]() on [Learning Arduino](http://learning-arduino.tumblr.com/).

Enjoy.
